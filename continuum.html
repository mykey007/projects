                  <h5 class="THD-h5">Explaining Why User-Centered Design is Important</h5>
                  <p>Initially, my requirement from my stakeholder was to only focus on the UI of the product. However, I knew that as a UX designer, my job is to advocate for the users and to coordinate the whole balanced team to come up with the best product designs. <span class="highlight highlight-THD">After consulting my design manager and other senior designers for advice, I set up a meeting with my stakeholder to explain the user-centered design process I hoped to follow.</span>  I proposed a timeline to make sure that the product can still be built within the time constraints, and explained why adding activities like interviews, brainstorming sessions, and user feedback would help the team fail fast and eventually build a better product that people would love using. My stakeholder became really supportive of our process after the meeting.<br><br>

                  From this experience, I learned about how to advocate for design when necessary. <span class="highlight highlight-THD">It is important not to blindly stick to a "process", but to understand why different design activities help us build better products, and to convey the value of those activities to stakeholders and other team members.</span>
                  </p>

                  <h5 class="THD-h5">Engaging Developers and Stakeholders throughout the Process</h5>

                  <p>Taking the advice of senior designers, my co-intern Chandler and I invited our developers to sit in on our interviews and usability testing sessions. We also held design studios in which we presented the top pain points we identified through research and let everyone brainstorm solutions together.</p>

                  <p><span class="highlight highlight-THD">One thing I found to be really effective was to keep our synthesize notes on a wall/window so that we can quickly show the main take-aways from our research to our developers and stakeholders when they come by.</span> The notes would also spark conversations with other colleagues on the floor.</p>

                  <p>As a result of those conversations, several developer interns on the floor became interested in our work, and started volunteering to come to our research and design activities. <span class="highlight highlight-THD">One developer intern even held his own design studio after he attended ours and realized the value it brings to the product.</span>
                   </p>

                  <h4>The Business Side</h4><br>
                  <h5 class="THD-h5">Working with Business Requirements</h5>
                  <p class="small-margin-bottom">During my onboarding process, I learned about the importance of gathering requirements from the development team and stakeholders. Therefore, during our first week, we led a kickoff meeting with our entire team, in which we discussed:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><span class="highlight highlight-THD"><strong>Goals:</strong></span> What should we try to achieve by the end of the summer? What is everyone’s goal for this project?</li>
                    <li><span class="highlight highlight-THD"><strong>Success:</strong></span> How do we measure our success through quantitative and qualitative measures? </li>
                    <li><span class="highlight highlight-THD"><strong>Risks:</strong></span> What are some of the factors that might prevent us from achieving our goals? What do we need to think more about before diving into the project?</li>
                    <li><span class="highlight highlight-THD"><strong>Assumptions:</strong></span> What does the team assume to be true? What needs to be validated through research? </li>
                  </ul>

                  <p class="img-caption">My co-intern Chandler and I leading the kickoff meeting with our stakeholders and developers.</p>

                  <p>We encouraged everyone to answer these questions individually using sticky notes to make sure that everyone’s voice is heard. <span class="highlight highlight-THD">Learning from people who’ve been developing the product really helped me understand the scope of my project and prioritize my goals.</span> I also derived a couple of things I wanted to verify through user research. </p>

                  <h5 class="THD-h5">Balancing Business Needs and User Needs</h5>
                  <p><span class="highlight highlight-THD">Despite the importance of business requirements, I kept my initial interviews pretty open-ended</span> to really understand what the users' goals are, what their frustrations are, and what they say about the current product. </p>

                  <h5 class="THD-h5">Running Meetings Efficiently</h5>
                  <p>When doing school projects, we seldom had the need to reflect on how our group meetings should work, and sometimes we ended up going down the rabbit hole during our discussions, and meeting for a much longer time than expected. In the industry, with everyone’s busy schedule and limited meeting spaces, I had to plan and facilitate meetings efficiently.</p>

                  <h5 class="THD-h5">Helping Users and Teammates</h5>
                  <p>One of the eight values on the Home Depot’s value wheel is “Building Strong Relationships,” and I really learned its importance through the internship. When conducting interviews, I was not only doing it for my job—I sincerely wanted to help my interviewees because I saw them spending so much time doing things that are trivial and frustrating. <span class="highlight highlight-THD">As I had learned from a couple of senior designers, after my users considered me to be a part of them, they were more willing to share their ideas and set up times to talk with me; and I was able to better help them, as a result.</span></p>

                  <h5 class="THD-h5">Considering Developers' Needs</h5>
                  <p>Taking into consideration the technical constraints is important. After ideating on our solutions, I would sketch out the features we think are the best and ask the developers on our team about their feasibility. <span class="highlight highlight-THD">As a former developer myself, I realized I could easily discuss with them the time and effort it takes to implement each design alternative, and then balance it with the quality of the idea from the user’s perspective.</span></p>

                <h4>What Makes a Good Designer</h4>
                <br>

                <h5 class="THD-h5">Influence and Leadership</h5>
                <p>Through my conversations with my manager, I have learned that great designers are not only good at design itself; <span class="highlight highlight-THD">they’re also people who can influence others, who can help others on the team achieve their goals, and who can let the whole team leverage their own strengths to contribute to the product.</span><br><br>

                While at the Home Depot, I’ve been trying to bring together the business side, the technical side, and the design side, and let everyone contribute to the design of the product. I’ll keep on learning from more experienced design leaders, and strive to become one myself.
               </p>

               <h5 class="THD-h5">Design the Design Process</h5>
               <p>Despite the popular “Double Dimond” representation of the design process, the real process is always messy and full of uncertainties. A problem solver at heart, I have learned to intentionally choose the activities I lead for my purpose, and to reflect on how I did afterwards. I have come to believe that <span class="highlight highlight-THD">a good designer would approach any problems he or she encounters with a designer’s mindset, to experiment with different approaches, fail fast, and constantly reflect on past experiences to seek improvement.</span></p>

               <h5 class="THD-h5">"User-Centered Communication"</h5>
               <p>Since designers need to work on multidisciplinary teams, it is important for us to know how to talk with different people, whether they are users, engineers, product managers, or VPs. </p>

                <h4>Talking with More People</h4>
                <p>The Enterprise UX team at the Home Depot has over 180 designers; a lot of them have been in the industry for years and have an area that they excel at. I was lucky to be able to talk with a dozen designers and get their advice on how to improve my <span class="highlight highlight-THD">visual design skills, facilitation skills, business sense, and how to plan my career path.</span> I also got to know other designers by participating in design critiques, workshops, testings, and lunch & learn sessions. </p>

                <h4>Asking for More Feedback</h4>
                <p>Even though Chandler and I reflected a lot on each activity we led and invited senior designers to review all of our interview/testing scripts, we could have been more proactive in seeking out feedback. For example, if we had invited senior designers to sit in on our interviews/testings/design studios, we could have got more direct feedback on our facilitation skills. <span class="highlight highlight-THD">As I grow as a designer, I’ll remember to keep asking feedback from people around me, whether it’s on my design, or on my way of leading design activities.</span> </p>
