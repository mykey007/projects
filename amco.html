                    <h4>The Challenge</h4>

                    <p>There was a need for Amco, an English as a Second Language (ESL) company, to <span class="highlight highlight-THD">develop a new learning product aimed at students in grades K-9</span>.</p>

                    <p>These were <span class="highlight highlight-THD">primarily native Spanish speakers</span> taking, administering and grading the test, so the English used needed to be instructive, concise and keep the attention of both children and adults.</p>

                    <h4 id="solution">Solution</h4>
                    <p>Team up with some of the most talented UX &amp; UI practitioners I've ever met. As the dedicated developer on the team, we were able to iterate and prototype unusually fast. This led to many dead-ends that turned out to have hidden pathways. 10/10 would work like this again. </p>

              <h4>Approach</h4>

              <p>We started with one premise: it's a lot different being a kid, and a student, than it was when we were growing up. We saw this first-hand in a trip to a school in Mexico to do some user testing - general observation and hallway testing. <span class="highlight highlight-THD">We wanted to start at a place of compassion even if we couldn't reach complete understanding.</span></p>

              <p>There were some well-formed bad habits that had developed before this engagement. We needed to clear the air with designers and engineers to ensure everyone was on the same page. After brainstorming with the design team <span class="highlight highlight-THD">we began working in design sprints.</span> These were usually one week in length and would be anywhere from 2 weeks to 3 months ahead of engineering sprints.</p>

                   <p>The first step our team took was to interview the stakeholders. This included the executive team and the various country liaisons for the schools. They gave us the sign-off to conduct competitor analysis and tailor solutions that made sense for the ESL space.</p>

                  <p>This helped steer us towards synthesizing the vision for the product and how it aligned with the overall business goals, and how success (and failure) will be measured.</p>

                  <p>After that we had the unique ability to travel to Guadalajara to interview and observe the customers in their environment. We observed 6 schools and conducted over 30 interviews with faculty, staff and students. </p>

                  <p>This project was a first for Amco since they hadn't tried defining the user experience before the code.</p><!-- make this easier to understand: ask not what can we build, but what should we do -->
                  <p> Instead of addressing design and usability needs after an initial build, the project owners were open to listening to ideas, discussing options, and incorporating recommendations made by my team.</p>
                  <p>Some of the tools I used were:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Communication: Slack, Skype</li>
                    <li>Wireframes: Balsamiq</li>

                <p> While I wasn't able to be part of the EoS launch, it was a fascinating look into what my team did in order to put the user first while balancing the business needs.</p>

                <p> I'm very greatful for the people I met and the work we did. Everybody took pride in the product and it showed.</p>

                <p> This was a first for almost everyone involved in the project. There were issues that could have been addressed earlier, but we need to factor in hind-sight . I would have been more insistant about decisions early on if the outcomes those paths led us down were clearer. There is no point in wondering if you can ask.</p>

                <p> Once it's launched, EoS will achieve the mission of helping students learn English and motivate teachers to inspire their students.</p>
