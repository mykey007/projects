                    <h4>The Challenge</h4>

                    <p>There was a need for Amco, an English as a Second Language (ESL) company, to <span class="highlight highlight-THD">develop a new learning product aimed at students in grades K-9</span>.</p>

                    <p>These were <span class="highlight highlight-THD">primarily native Spanish speakers</span> taking, administering and grading the test, so the English used needed to be instructive, concise and keep the attention of both children and adults.</p>

                    <h4 id="solution">Solution</h4>
                    <p>Team up with some of the most talented UX &amp; UI practitioners I've ever met. As the dedicated developer on the team, we were able to iterate and prototype unusally fast. This led to many dead-ends that turned out to have hidden pathways. 10/10 would work like this again. </p>

              <h4>Approach</h4>

              <p>We started with one premise: it's a lot different being a kid, and a student, than it was when we were growing up. We saw this first-hand in a trip to Guadalajara to do some user testing - general observation and hallway testing. <span class="highlight highlight-THD">We wanted to start at a place of compassion even if we couldn't reach complete understanding.</span></p>

              <p class="small-margin-bottom">There were some well-formed bad habits that had developed before this engagement. We needed to clear the air with designers and engineers to ensure everyone was on the same page. After brainstorming with the design team <span class="highlight highlight-THD">we began working in design sprints.</span> These were usually one week in length and would be anywhere from 2 weeks to 3 months ahead of engineering sprints.</p>

                  <h4>Discovery</h4>

                   <p>The first step our team took was to interview the stakeholders. This included the executive team and the various country liaisons for the schools. They gave us the sign-off to conduct competitor analysis and tailor solutions that made sense for the ESL space.</p>

                  <p>This helped steer us towards synthesizing the vision for the product and how it aligned with the overall business goals, and how success (and failure) will be measured.</p>

                  <p>After that we had the unique ability to travel to Guadalajara to interview and observe the customers in their environment. We observed 6 schools and conducted over 30 interviews with faculty, staff and students. </p>

                  <p>I was new to the education space. So I needed to learn what a rubric was and how a teacher's teaching style would influence my choices. Research was key in supporting both the business goals and achieving success with the students and administrators using the software.</p>

                  <p>Taking cues from apps like Duolingo and busuu I immediately began reading as much as I could on topics such as how children learn; how people learn a second language, and which screen displays work best for test-takers. </p>

                  <p>This project was a first for Amco since they hadn't tried defining the user experience before the code.</p><!-- make this easier to understand: ask not what can we build, but what should we do -->
                  <p> Instead of addressing design and usability needs after an initial build, the project owners were open to listening to ideas, discussing options, and incorporating recommendations made by my team.</p>
                  <p>Some of the tools I used were:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Communication: Slack, Skype</li>
                    <li>Wireframes: Balsamiq</li>

                <p>By working as a team, we were able to deliver a system that can handle any amount of content and is completely scalable. This new area of the site is modeled after the Netflix content strategy: cross-categories are anticipated and encouraged. An updated experience for constantly updating information.</p>

                <p>Now every page and every piece of content is traceable in the various analytic tools the college uses. And people have easy-to-use paths to help navigate them through the 100+ years of content the site has to offer.</p>
                <p>
                  Not every feature we planned on was incorporated into the launch. But moving fast and getting real-time feedback helped us keep the wire frames and prototypes just that: smaller parts of a whole.
